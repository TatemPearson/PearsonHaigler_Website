          <h2>Plasma Screen</h2>
          <p>
            What sets the Portable III apart from its predecesors is the amber gas plasma display. 
            The plasma display made it possible to drop a few pounds and be smaller than if it were to use a small CRT like the Portables that came becore it. 
            Plasma displays of this era, however are infamous for being delicate and hard to repair. The Column Driver ICs that power each line drawn on the screen
            are sensitive to dust, causing shorts. This is what causes pale orange lines and/or dead spots to appear on the screen. Dead spots can also appear for another reason, 
            worn out solder. The high voltage nature of this part causes it to run hot, and the constant heating and cooling from either normal use or being exposed to 
            heat and cold puts a strain on the solder joints of the column drivers. Dead spots indicate circuits that are failing to transport power at all. Bad electrolytic capacitors
            can also cause a "fog" to appear on screen. Be very careful when working on this part, the flex and ribbon cables are very delicate in addition to high voltage. 
            When cleaning this part, the technician's manual states to ONLY use isopropyl alcohol when cleaning the inside of the screen, in addition it is also reccommended 
            by hobbyists to use the strongest alcohol you can find when doing so.

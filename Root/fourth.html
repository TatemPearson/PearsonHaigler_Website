          <h2>Rotting Keyboard Cable</h2>
          <p>
            Dry rot of the keyboard connector cable is common. 
            This only affects the casing and the keyboard may work just fine, but the rotting cable is unsightly and leaves flakes everywhere.
            This is a fairly easy fix with DIN5 extension cables being common and cheap online. 
            See Advanced Issues for the in depth guide on solving the problem. <!--Instead of being delegated to Advanced Issues, links to articles will be provided for solutions-->

          <h2>Dead CMOS Battery</h2>
          <p>
            This issue may only become apparent later, as sometimes the battery still has some juice in it upon bootup. You need the diagnostics floppy disk to access the BIOS and reenter settings, which has been made freely available online. 
            Documentation on replacing the battery is nonexistent. And by modern standards this battery is strange, a dual cell 3.4V Lithium brick. 
            Finding a way to get a 3.3V coin cell battery to take its place is the best way to fix this.

        <h2>Dirty or Jammed Floppy Drive</h2>
        <p>
          Dust in the floppy drive may make the drive not function properly, in addition to drive rails getting jammed after years of not being used.
           A good clean with isopropyl alcohol and lubrication of the rails with lithium grease should fix this issue.

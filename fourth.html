          <h2>Rotting Keyboard Cable</h2>
          <p>
            Dry rot of the keyboard connector cable is common. 
            This only affects the casing and the keyboard may work just fine, but the rotting cable is unsightly and leaves flakes everywhere.
            This is a fairly easy fix with DIN5 extension cables being common and cheap online. To take the keyboard assembly apart, 
            remove all the keys, as the screws are located underneath them and you will want to clean them anyways. There is one screw under 
            the logo badge on the top right of the keyboard case which can be removed with a flathead screwdiver without hurting it, since it is aluminum. 
            You can reattach it later with double sided tape. With the replacement cable cut off the female end such that the male end (end with pins) has a desireable 
            amount of slack. Multimeter the joints labeled 1-5 and note which pin goes where. Note that one pin on replacement cable is unused. Desolder original wire 
            and expose the replacement pin wires. Solder the new wires in their proper places, be careful to avoid cold joints and overheating the board. After cleaning the 
            casing reassemble the keyboard, make sure no debris is on the PCB, as it could interfere with keystrokes. Troubleshoot and fix as needed. If you cannot test on original 
            hardware, you may need DIN5 to PS/2 adapter and possibly a PS/2 to USB adapter, there you can run it through a <a href="https://www.keyboardtester.com">key tester</a>. 
            Note that Enter, Shift, Control, and a few others may not turn green but will be functional.

          <h2>Dead CMOS Battery</h2>
          <p>
            This issue may only become apparent later, as sometimes the battery still has some juice in it upon bootup. You need the diagnostics floppy disk to access the BIOS and reenter settings, which has been made freely available online. 
            Documentation on replacing the battery is nonexistent. And by modern standards this battery is strange, a dual cell 3.4V Lithium brick. Refurbishing the oringinal
            or modding in a modern replacement are the only options here. WARNING: tampering with battery cells is a fire hazard.

        <h2>Dirty or Jammed Floppy Drive</h2>
        <p>
          Dust in the floppy drive may make the drive not function properly, in addition to drive rails getting jammed after years of not being used.
           A good clean with isopropyl alcohol and lubrication of the rails with lithium grease should fix this issue.

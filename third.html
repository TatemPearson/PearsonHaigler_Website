          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>Compaq was most famous for the Portable lineup in the 80s. 
            Able to do the impressive feat of making portable computers run better than the original IBM hardware they were “imitating”. 
            The Portable III is an interesting machine with many of the innovative features Compaq was known for. 
            The Intel 386 processor was released in 1985, and Compaq wanted to use this new 32-bit processor for its third-generation of the Portable lineup. 
            However, this was not possible due to a lack of supporting hardware because the processor was so new. 
            Increasing competition also meant market dominance was threatened if they waited. 
            The 16-bit 286 was still a perfectly capable and respectable standard for the era and as a stop gap they released the Compaq Portable III with 286 hardware as a stopgap with great reception. 
            An interesting feature of the 286 model is its ability to swap clock speeds between 8-12 MHz based on compatibility. 
            Like the hybrid video cards of the Portable lineup, it could be hard set to one speed or the other, but by default switches according to software needs. 
            The 386 runs on 20MHz.

          <h2>Innovations of the Portable Lineup</h2>
          <p>Compaq had to get creative when designing the portable lineup. Say you wanted to buy an IBM PC, you would have to choose a graphics card and the monitor to support it. 
            MDA (Monocrhome Display Adapter) Was a monochrome graphics mode typically in green or amber colors. 
            Businesses claimed MDA graphics were easier on the eyes and the conserved resources that would otherwise be invested into color can be utilized for sharper looking text.
            CGA (Color Graphics Adapter) was more expensive but offered (by today’s standards crude) color to your machine. CGA Text is a bit “chunky” and the overall resolution of CGA was lower than MDA.
            With Compaq’s portable lineup, the monitor was built in and in order to make the machine accessible they made a hybrid graphics card that supports both CGA and MDA. 
            The built-in monitor for most Portables was monochrome, but CGA could be fully utilized on an external monitor. 
            The hybrid card could be hard-set to one mode and by default it could also swap on the fly based on software needs.

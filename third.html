          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>Compaq was most famous for the Portable lineup in the 80s. 
            Able to do the impressive feat of making portable computers run better than the original IBM hardware they were “imitating”. 
            The Portable III is an interesting machine with many of the innovative features Compaq was known for. 
            The Intel 386 processor was released in 1985, and Compaq wanted to use this new 32-bit processor for its third-generation of the Portable lineup. 
            However, this was not possible due to a lack of supporting hardware because the processor was so new. 
            Increasing competition also meant market dominance was threatened if they waited. 
            The 16-bit 286 was still a perfectly capable and respectable standard for the era, so they released the Compaq Portable III with 286 hardware as a stopgap with great reception. 
            An interesting feature of the 286 model is its ability to swap clock speeds between 8-12 MHz based on compatibility. 
            Like the hybrid video cards of the Portable lineup, it could be hard set to one speed or the other, but by default switches according to software needs. 
            The 386 runs on 20MHz. Overall the Compaq Portable III was well recieved, as seen in <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/business/1987/07/20/compaqs-new-portable-iii-a-screaming-speed-machine/8bd56ca6-d127-40a8-91c5-8170efd06db8/" target="_blank">

          <h2>Innovations of the Portable Lineup</h2>
          <p>Compaq had to get creative when designing the portable lineup. Say you wanted to buy an IBM PC, you would have to choose a graphics card and the monitor to support it. 
            MDA (Monocrhome Display Adapter) Was a monochrome graphics mode typically in green or amber colors. 
            Businesses claimed MDA graphics were easier on the eyes and the conserved resources that would otherwise be invested into color can be utilized for sharper looking text.
            CGA (Color Graphics Adapter) was more expensive but offered (by today’s standards crude) color to your machine. CGA Text is a bit “chunky” and the overall resolution of CGA was lower than MDA.
            With Compaq’s portable lineup, the monitor was built in and in order to make the machine accessible they made a hybrid graphics card that supports both CGA and MDA. 
            The built-in monitor for most Portables was monochrome, but CGA could be fully utilized on an external monitor. 
            The hybrid card could be hard-set to one mode and by default it could also swap on the fly based on software needs. Much of Compaq's marketing claimed they could run IBM 
            software faster than IBM themselves, this was done through proprietary chips that boosted the performance of the Portable lineup.

          <h2>Expandability</h2>
          <p>
            In addition to their portability (relative to the even larger desktops of the era), Compaq Portables were also expandable allowing for more RAM, storage, the addition of a modem 
            and the addition of other peripherals such as sound cards. These expansion slots used what was known as ISA (Industry Standard Architecture). Expandability looks
            quite reasonable in the Portable I or II as they are about the size of briefcases, but you may wonder how the lunchbox sized Portable III pulled this off. The answer was the option 
            of buying a little sidecar-type attachment with your Portable III, which plugged into the back of the machine and gave 2 ISA slots. In the Operations User Manual it is 
            primarily advertised as a backup hard drive expansion unit. With mine there was a joystick port expansion card and an IEEE-488 port in the expansion unit. The PortableIII
            also had two internal expansion slots but they only supported propietary modems and RAM expansions.

        <h2>After the Portable III</h2>
        <p>
          In 1991 one last "luggable" would come out, the Portable 486. This utilized the Intel 486 CPU at 33MHz and had 4-32MB of RAM. The 486c is notable as 
          it has a full color screen, instead of the monochrome green or amber of its predacessors. By this point, however the luggable era was over and laptops were 
          entering the scene. Compaq themselves began making laptops shortly after the Portable III hit store shelves. The portable 486 was discontinued in 1999, and a contributor 
          its long life despite the end of the luggable era amounted to the niche uses utlized for it. The 486 was widely used as a network sniffer and a portable presentation tool. 
          While laptops were more widely available and more on par with desktops in terms of power, they lacked digital sound cards and their displays were often quite dim. The 
          Portable 486 had ISA expansion slots, which sound cards were common options to insert into these slots in addition additional ports. These features made it a good option for 
          people who gave frequent presentations on the road. Despite carving this niche, the 486 still did not sell well overall, but was still known for its quality and power like 
          the Portables that came before it.
